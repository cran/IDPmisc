    (=FALSE) or not (=TRUE). Horizontal lines, defined by \code{h1} or
    \code{h2} are always clipped. }

    BMP (Windows bitmap format), TIFF, PostScript or PDF.
    Defaults to Windows meta file, \code{"wmf"} ,
    with the extension \code{".wmf"}.
    Cf. \code{\link[grDevices]{savePlot}}.
    \cr
    \emph{On non Windows operating systems}: A device
    function (e.g., x11, postscript,...). The filetype
    defaults to \code{postscript} , with the extension
    \code{".ps"}. Cf. \code{\link[grDevices]{dev.print}}

\details{
  For longer time-series, it is sometimes important to spread several
  time-series plots over several subplots or even over several pages
  with several subplots in each. Moreover, these series have often
  different ranges, frequencies and start times. There is sometimes also
  the need of a more flexible annotation of axes than \code{plot.ts}
  provides. \code{longtsPlot} provides the user with all these features
  for one or two matrices or regular time series (time series matrices).

\section{Side Effects}{
  One or more pages of time series plots are drawn on the current
  graphic device and, optionally, saved in one or more files.
